# Blockers

Single place to collect anything that requires user input (credentials, environment-specific choices, unclear product decisions) during long autonomous runs.

## How To Use
- Add a dated entry (YYYY-MM-DD) with a short title.
- Include: what is blocked, why, what I tried, and the minimum decision needed.
- Then continue working on the next best parallel task.

## Current Blockers
- None
